# How to Activate the Git Hooks

This repo ships two shell-based hooks under `.githooks/` — no runtime or dependencies required, so they work identically regardless of the project's language.

## Steps

Running `./bin/mat setup` (or `.\bin\mat.ps1` on native Windows) from the
repository root does this for you, along with the rest of local project
setup. To activate just the hooks by hand:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

That's it — this is a one-time, per-clone setting stored in your local Git config, not committed to the repo.

## What each hook does

| Hook | Runs on | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `commit-msg` | every `git commit` | Rejects commit messages that don't follow [Conventional Commits](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-conventions) |
| `pre-push` | every `git push` | Placeholder — uncomment the test/build checks inside `.githooks/pre-push` to run them before every push |

## Why this is optional but recommended

Activating the hook is not required to contribute — `commit-msg` validation also runs in CI on every pull request as a backstop, so a bad commit message is still caught before merge even if you skip this step. Activating it locally just gives you the same feedback earlier, before you push.
