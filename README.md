## Overview

Describe the problem this project solves, its main features, and any key design decisions worth highlighting upfront.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
./bin/mat setup   # Git hooks, .env, dev shell (Nix/direnv/devenv), repo config
```

On native Windows (no WSL2), run `.\bin\mat.ps1` instead.

Full setup guide (prerequisites, dependency install, dev server): [docs/product-code/tutorials/getting-started](docs/product-code/tutorials/getting-started.md).
